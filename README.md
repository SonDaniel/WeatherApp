#Synopsis
This is a simple web application testing my knowledge on Angularjs. The index.htm allows the user to
input a city and will bring out the temperature forecast for 2,5,7 days of the city.

#Motivation
This was created with a video guide and I just wanted to retain the knowledge of coding in Angular.
